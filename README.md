 Type: Report (Individual)
 Learning Objectives Assessed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

 Weight: 40%
 Submission: via Turnitin link on Blackboard
Task Description:
In this final assessment, you will be tested on your ability to bring together all the learned concepts in creative strategy theory covered this semester.
As part of this assessment, you will be required to create and sell-in (via a pre-recorded pitch video) your own, original, creative strategy in response to a client brief.
Polished, produced (digital, social media, and print/transit) executions of advertisement concepts will be developed as part of this assessment, based on your Big Idea for the campaign.
In addition to responding to the client brief, you will write a Creative Rationale to explain and justify the creative elements of the campaign’s creative strategy and record a short   5-minute Pitch video, selling your creative ideas persuasively.
This is an individual assessment and as such, students should not work with/collaborate with other students in the cohort when working on this creative strategy campaign.
This assessment is 100% practical - therefore no references are required, all content should be original and unique to the development of your own ad strategies. This also means that there should be no issues with similarity in your written Creative Rationale, etc.
The following table outlines the three parts to this assessment item:


Part 1: Ads
Creative Development and Execution: Based on the client brief and key insight presented, develop the Big Idea and design 3x creative executions for the ad campaign – for the following media channels:
1) Digital video ad (30 seconds)
2) Social Media post (select a SM vehicle you feel appropriate for the TA) and
3) Transit ad (select from the following transit channels: adshel (bus shelter), bus back (or posters inside the bus), train station advertising, taxi backs or other forms of transit advertising)
Further notes:
➢ This task requires you to design three (3) ad executions of the same Big Idea for the ad campaign. There should be message consistency across the three ad executions.
➢ For your 30 second digital video ad example – include the link to your video on the TITLE page (and can also be included in the Part 1 section) of your document.
➢ Your advertising executions (SM and print examples etc) should be well presented, showing 1x ad execution per (A4) page (sell your creative visually, don’t insert small visuals of the ad etc).
➢ For the transit ad execution: this could be displayed as a static visual for the ad, or if you have decided to use a digital billboard (such as on some AdShels) you could show the various images of the ad execution (i.e., show the代 写ADVT7509 Creative Advertising Development Assessment #3Java

Part 2: Rationale
Creative Rationale: Based on the Big Idea you developed for your campaign creative, now write the Creative Rationale to explain and support your strategy.
In this section you should include (based on the identified Key Consumer Insight) discussion on the following:
 SMP (single minded proposition)
 Big Idea and Creative Strategy (explain in 25 words or less and then support how you brought this idea to life)
 Message strategy
 Appeals used and why?
 Execution style. used and why?
Overall, why you believe this creative strategy will be most effective in connecting with the target audience and achieving the set IMC objectives?
➢ The Creative Rationale can be written as a reflection, to explain your strategy.
➢ Therefore, no references or connections to theory (as in, citations for support) are needed in this section.
➢ The written rationale should be no more than 2 pages (approx. 1,000 words).
➢ Please use Times New Roman, 12pt font, minimum 1.15 line spacing.
➢ All submissions must be written in English.




Part 3: Pitch
The 5-minute Pitch: record a Pitch video (100% you to camera) to explain your campaign creative. The pitch should not be a simple word for word read of the creative rationale.
In your Pitch video include discussion of the following (but not limited to):
 Start with a quick outline of who the client is and the market they compete in…
 Based on the IMC objectives stated in the client brief, what is a/some creative objectives for the campaign to achieve?
 Explain who the target audience is and what you want them to think/feel/do after seeing your ads?
 Explain the creative concept/big idea you have developed (tell the story) and why you’ve come up with it?
 What is the message strategy, appeals used and execution style. and the tone of the ad/s?
 ….and finally, why you think this creative campaign will be effective?
Further notes:
➢ Imagine (pretend) you are face-to-face pitching your creative strategy to the client.
➢ You should appear on screen for all (or most) of the 5 minutes: you can cut away to quickly show other visuals (support content or your ad executions etc).
➢ You can use slides (PPT visuals) in the background or cut into your pitch video. However, if you use slides – you do not need to submit these slides as part of your assessment. You will be graded purely on the 5-minute Pitch video.
➢ IMPORTANT – you need to upload your 5-minute Pitch video through the ‘VIDEO Submission Link’ on Blackboard in the A3 submission folder.
